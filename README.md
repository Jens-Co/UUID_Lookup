how does it work?

1) Install NodeJS which is the platform our site/api runs on.

2) open the terminal and enter command `npm install`, This can take a few min as this will install all required packages.

3) Enter command `node app.js`, this command will start up the website instance and console should log 'Server started' your instance will now be available on url 'localhost'

4) Since we are using official Xbox requests you will need to authenticate with microsoft xbox live click on the link that will appear in console and copy the access code. once authenticated you can use the lookup funtions.
