# gfapi-website

how does it work?

1) Install NodeJS which is the platform our site/api runs on.

2) open the terminal and enter command `npm install`, This can take a few min as this will install all required packages.

3) you need to create/change the .env/ or rename .env.example. You can obtain an api key from [Here](https://xbl.io/guides/creating_apps). do know that its not needed ( you wont be able to search accounts ).

4) Enter command `node app.js`, this command will start up the website instance and console should log 'Server started' your instance will now be available on url 'localhost'
